# Platformer Prototype
Personal project by Mihai ANCA.

After my first internship and discovering Unity, I have tried to learn how to implement various systems such as health, money and stamina and creating objects to collect and different ways to consume them. There are various animations I have added and a Character Controller I have finetuned.
